v0.2:
- Now supports Monkey Island 1 and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
   (rooms weren't being numbered properly, MI2 just happened to have no
   gaps in its room numbering). FoA has not been tested much, it does
   throw up some problems with SOUN blocks, but appears to repack okay.
- NLSC blocks are generated when packing, so you can add new local scripts
   (LSCR blocks).
- RMHD blocks are partially generated when packing - they now record the
   number of objects in a room, so there is the potential to add new ones.
- Room names are now read, stored in the LFLF directory name. Names are
   padded/truncated to 9 characters on packing, but there will probably
   be bugs with non-ASCII names.
- CHAR, COST, SCRP and SOUN blocks are now numbered correctly (were 1
   higher than they should have been).
- Cleaned up the command line options a bit. You'll mostly want to use "-e"
   and "-p" to extract and pack respectively. Specify the game with 
   "-g [MI1|MI2|FOA]". Less useful commands have been labelled "[Expert]".
- Generated directory files (e.g. "DSOU.gen", "DCOS.gen") are deleted when
   extraction finishes.
- Workaround for Monkey Island 1 CD SOUN blocks which have no sub-blocks.

v0.1:
- Initial release. Only supports Monkey Island 2.
